# Asynchronous JavaScript Color Changer

This project is a simple web application that demonstrates asynchronous JavaScript by dynamically changing the background color of the page every second.<br>

## Features
- Dynamic Background Color: The application generates a random color and updates the background color of the page at regular intervals.
- Start/Stop Functionality: Users can control the background color changes by clicking the "Start" and "Stop" buttons.

## How to Use
1. Open the HTML file (index.html) in a web browser.
2. Click the "Start" button to initiate the asynchronous color changes.
3. To stop the color changes, click the "Stop" button.

## Project Structure
- **HTML File:** The main HTML file (index.html) defines the structure of the web page and includes links to the JavaScript and CSS files.

- **JavaScript File:** The JavaScript file (color_changer.js) contains the logic for generating random colors and implementing the start/stop functionality.

## Getting Started

To experience the asynchronous color changes, open the index.html file in a web browser. Check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/GautamShriharsh/Async_JavaScript_Color_Changer) for the latest updates and source code.
